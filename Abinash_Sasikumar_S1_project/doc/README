First up is the Server.py:

I used Flask framework . This file has a connection variable 'db' which is used to connect to 'mysql'. 
There are routes created along with the controller function. There are two types of routes: routes that return
a template(html page) and routes that return data. More will be explained along

Second up is the index.html:

I have used two routes in this page.The first is the route "/" with the index() controller that return a html page along with some data.The second is the route "/attendance" with pie_chart_data() controller that returns data that we can get with fetch request function. This is so that I can pass this data to pass into the charts generating function.

When we click the each attributes in the active population section of each year. It will go to its respective 
population_(year)_(program).html.

Note:
The population_(year)_(program).html are not dynamic as I didn't learn how to create pages dynamically at the time.

Third up is the population_(year)_(program).html:

The html page is rendered using the route "/population_(year)_(program).html"

Here I have generated the table of students with their first name,last name and courses passed.The data is fetched using the route "/population/(year)/(program)" with the population_(year)_(program)_fetch() controller.
 
I have generated the table of courses along with their duration for the respective program using "/course/()".

When one clicks any student data , it will redirect of the grades of the respective student using the route "/student.html?email=".This is so that we can render data dynamically.

Finally, it is student.html:

The route "/student" will return grade by taking the 'email' attribute from the template url.
